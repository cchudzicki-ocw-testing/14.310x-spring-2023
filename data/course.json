  "course_description": "This course introduces methods for harnessing data to answer questions of\u00a0  \ncultural, social, economic, and policy interest. We will start with essential\u00a0  \nnotions of probability and statistics. We will proceed to cover techniques in\u00a0  \nmodern data analysis: regression and econometrics, design of experiments,\u00a0  \nrandomized control trials (and A/B testing), machine learning, data visualization.\n\nWe will illustrate these concepts with applications drawn from real\u00a0  \nworld examples and frontier research. Finally, we will provide instruction on\u00a0  \nthe use of the statistical package R, and opportunities for students to perform self-directed empirical analyses.\n\nThis course draws materials from previous versions of [14.310x *Data Analysis for Social Scientists*](https://mitxonline.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITxT+14.310x/) taught on MITx Online, which provides certification for a fee. This version on OpenCourseWare is free and open to the public and does not require registration. However, OpenCourseWare does not offer a certificate or degree for completing this course.",
